# Evaluating cryptocurrency security in a quantum context (semi-technical summary)
_September 2020_
## Intro
Insight recently completed an examination of Monero’s cryptographic mechanisms in the context of several well-known quantum computing methods, primarily Shor’s algorithm, Grover’s algorithm, and Simon’s algorithm. The cryptographic underpinnings of essentially all cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, etc) are based on the fact that certain types of mathematical problems are effectively impossible for classical computers to solve. However algorithms designed for quantum computers theoretically allow them to solve these problems that are intractable otherwise.
## Impacts
Here we explore how known algorithms theoretically impact Monero’s current cryptographic mechanisms. Excluding the first subsection (public addresses --> private keys) these descriptions assume that the attacker has no information besides publicly-available on-chain information. 

### Extracting private keys from public addresses
Monero currently relies on an elliptic curve cryptographic protocol for generating public wallet addresses, subaddresses, and transactions. Randomly-generated private keys are used to deterministically derive the public keys, which become part of the address (or subaddress). For a classical computer, the private keys --> public keys calculation is a one-way function (because of the “discrete log problem”). However, a quantum adversary could reverse that function and extract private keys from public keys, enabling calculation of a wallet’s seed from its public address. This concern affects essentially every cryptocurrency, and is not specific to Monero.

### Ring signatures (privacy for the sender)
For each transaction input, the sender creates a “ring signature” that hides the true source of funds among decoys (currently the “ring size” is 11, meaning that the true input is hidden among 10 decoys). The sender knows which one of the members is the real signature amongst the decoys, but this should be difficult for an outsider to discern without solving the discrete logarithm problem (or leveraging information obtained from OSINT or metadata). However, a quantum adversary could identify the true input by extracting its private transaction key from the “linkability tag” (also known as the “key image”) used to prevent an output being spent twice. As a result, ring signatures and thus sender anonymity could be compromised by a quantum adversary. This concern affects every cryptographic protocol that currently utilizes ring signatures.

### Supply security (fake transaction amounts)
In order to mask the amounts used in each transaction, Monero employs a scheme in which each user cryptographically “commits” to a certain value. While a classical computer is effectively bound to the true committed value, a quantum computer can fraudulently open a commitment to any value it desires, including negative values. The value is later proven to lie in a valid range valid to prevent overflow issues in arithmetic using a range proving system known as bulletproofs. These proofs are constructed such that it is difficult to fool them without solving the discrete logarithm and finding the pre-image to a hash function. A quantum computer can neither construct a proof that fails verification with otherwise valid data, nor extract the secret committed amount from a bulletproof. However, a quantum computer may be able to generate an apparently valid bulletproof without ever knowing the secret data necessary to honestly compute that proof. This trick is considered computationally intractable on a classical computer, but a quantum computer would be able to accomplish it exponentially faster. This concern affects every cryptographic protocol that uses the bulletproof proving system.
## Mitigations
Post-quantum cryptography has been developed that has been proven secure against a classical or quantum adversary. Besides exotic cryptographic protocols, other simple but effective mitigation tactics can be employed as well; for example, doubling hash input lengths can mitigate against Grover’s algorithm. Primary weaknesses within Monero’s security infrastructure against a quantum adversary mainly stem from a fundamental reliance on elliptic curve cryptography, which it would render insecure. The main alternatives to elliptic curve cryptography that explored in our audit were multivariate-, lattice-, hash-, and supersingular isogeny-based cryptography. There are a few documented (but not yet implemented) protocols that can replicate many security features of Monero, such as the promising Raptor linkable ring signatures and the MatRiCT transaction protocol, both based on quantum-secure lattice-based cryptography. 

These quantum-secure protocols feature some of the most cutting-edge innovations available among contemporary cryptography standards. By providing security against classical computers as well as quantum computers, these cryptographic standards offer long-term security as a promising feature. However, this indefinite security often comes at the cost of larger key sizes and longer transaction generation and verification times. 

Further research aims to reduce this downside dramatically over the coming years. Even now, some of the most efficient post-quantum secure cryptography schemes have similar orders of magnitude in size and time requirements as current protocols. As such, these post-quantum secure alternatives already available could be considered seriously as replacements in the near future.
